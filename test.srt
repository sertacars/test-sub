-Doctor...
-Can you do it?

00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,680
There is a patient who came here
before these patients...

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,840
...with a COPD history, suffering
from shortness of breath...

highly possible pneumonia.

{\a8}Did you check her vitals?

00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,120
{\an8}It is 72%, pretty stable,
but she has a COPD history...

9
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,160
{\an8}Then do your job!
We're in the ER right now!

We should check her chest,

Do you know how to read?
What does it say there? Emergency.

Look, his BP is going down!
Whose case is more urgent?

{\an8}She might have sepsis,
is this not urgent?

{\an8}Don't move the iron rod.
Do you hear me?

Don't you dare!
I'll remove it.

Okay, sir. Understood.
