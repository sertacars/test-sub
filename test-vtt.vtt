-Doctor...
-Can you do it?

00:01.640 --> 00:03.680
There is a patient who came here
before these patients...

00:03.760 --> 00:05.840

from shortness of breath...

Did you check her vitals?

00:10.120 --> 00:12.120 line:20%
It is 72%, pretty stable,

We should check her chest,
or check her blood gas at least.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.840
Do you know how to read?
What does it say there? Emergency.

Look, his BP is going down!
